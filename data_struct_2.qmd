## Summary

In this chapter, we have completed our review of data structures. These data structures have different properties that influence how they are used in various computational tasks. Additionally, we have looked at the strengths and limitations of each structure for data analysis. However, we havenâ€™t discussed an important aspect of data structures: what do we do with missing data? In the final chapter, we will tackle this issue and provide solutions.
