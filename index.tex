This is the website for ``R for Novice Programmers.'' The goal of this
book is to introduce non-programmers or those with very little
programming experience to the benefits of the R and RStudio software.
The main prerequisites for learners are basic knowledge of computer
applications and experience working with files and folders. This book
will primarily focus on the basic R concepts that are hardly emphasized,
but that may prove difficult for learners new to programming.

The online version of this book is free to use and is licensed under the

This book was built with \href{https://quarto.org/}{Quarto}.

This book is primarily intended to cater to the needs of individuals who
have a desire to learn the basics of programming. I focus on R and
RStudio because their capabilities may be relevant to a wide variety of
individuals and organizations seeking to perform basic statistical
analysis and data visualization. Personally, my skills in R and RStudio
were gained via classroom instruction, online tutorials and videos, as
well as relevant blog posts. A significant disadvantage of some of these
resources is the assumption of prior programming knowledge. To address
this, I begin the book with instructions for downloading software,
navigating the R and RStudio interfaces, and an overview of the basics
of R to decrease the cognitive load on novices.

\subsection{Why learn R and RStudio?}\label{why-learn-r-and-rstudio}}

Both R and Studio are free, open-source software tools that are widely
used for statistical analysis and data visualization. R is a programming
language that enables the use of code to analyze data. The primary
function of the R language is statistical analysis and this can be
performed directly in the R console. To ease the analysis process and
enhance usability, an integrated development environment (IDE), such as
RStudio is recommended. The RStudio IDE is a user-friendly interface
that allows the learner to manage multiple script files, use the
command-line terminal, easily access file inputs and outputs, and review
file/analysis history.

The R programming language software was developed by Ross Ihaka and
Robert Gentleman in 1993 (published as open-source in 1995) when they
were based at the University of Auckland. \emph{Fun fact: R represents
the first letter of the first names of the creators}. The software is
utilized by individuals working for various organizations ranging from
academic institutions and healthcare organizations to financial services
and information technology companies. In January 2024, the
\href{https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html}{PopularitY of Programming
Language (PYPL) Index}, which is created by analyzing how often language
tutorials are searched on Google, demonstrated that R was the 6th most
popular programming language. However, in the same period, the TIOBE
index (https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) indicated that R was the 23rd
most popular language. This may result from different methodologies for
developing the rankings. RStudio is an integrated development
environment (IDE) for R that was developed by JJ Allaire. This software
contains tools that make programming in R easier.

RStudio extends R's capabilities by making it easier to import data,
write scripts, and generate visualizations and reports. The company
RStudio (now Posit since 2022) was founded in 2009 with the main goal of
``creating high quality open-source software for data scientists.''

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\roman{enumi}.}
\item
  The R and RStudio console can be used as a complex scientific
  calculator.
\item
  The values of various data types can be assigned to variables using
  the symbol \texttt{\textless{}-} or \texttt{=}.
\item
  Built-in functions can be used to manipulate variables.
\item
  Built-in datasets can be accessed internally for analysis.
\item
  New datasets can be imported and new functions can be created for
  custom analysis.
\item
  To aid in computational analysis, there exists a large package library
  (\href{https://cran.r-project.org/}{CRAN}), as well as a lot of
  software in development to aid in computational analysis.

\item
  A large number of user communities exists for the R/RStudio software.
  These communities (listed in the Appendix) provide learning support
  and assist with technical challenges,
\item
  Numerous freely available packages/extensions have been developed by
  the R and RStudio user communities to facilitate all forms of
  computational analysis, visualization, and publication. The
  (\href{https://cran.r-project.org/}{CRAN}) has packages that contain
  datasets as well as allow one to perform statistical analysis and data
  visualization,
\item
  R and RStudio allow for reproducible analysis where scripts and
  workflows can be shared with fellow users, and,
\item
  The R/RStudio software is cross-platform, which means that it can be
  used on Linux, Windows, and Mac operating systems.

\textbf{We have finally come to the end of the ``R for Novice
Programmers'' book. Congratulations on completing this learning
journey!}

The overall goal of this book was to introduce non-programmers or those
with very little programming experience to R and RStudio and their use
in basic statistical programming. It is hoped that the learners gained
new skills and discovered how this software could be used to simplify
everyday tasks in their workplaces. The learner should now be able to
understand all the topics listed below based on the previously described
learning objectives.

Now that the learner has mastered the basics, it is time to transition
to specific topics such as data wrangling/manipulation, data
visualization, and programming. Therefore, I would encourage the learner
to review some of the links I have provided in the Appendix and look out
for more books in the future which will cover:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\roman{enumi}.}
\item
  Data visualization
\item
  Tidyverse
\item
  Programming: Functions, Loops, and Control Statements
\item
  Data Science
\item
  Statistics
\item
  Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
\item
  Publishing with R Markdown and/or Quarto
\item
  R Shiny
