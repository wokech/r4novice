# Handling missing data {#sec-missing}

## Questions

-   What is missing data?

-   Why is missing data a common challenge in data analysis?

-   How can we identify and handle missing data effectively in R?

-   What are the consequences of ignoring or mishandling missing data?

-   What are the best practices for imputing missing values?

-   When should I choose deletion, imputation, or alternative approaches?

## Learning Objectives

-   Define the main types of missing data.

-   Identify missing data in R and assess its impact on analyses.

-   Work with datasets that contain missing data.

-   Understand the importance of addressing missing data in data analysis.

-   Apply best practices for handling missing data in your R projects.

-   Apply functions like is.na() and complete.cases() to identify NA values.

## Exercises

i.  Identify missing values in a dataset using the `is.na()` and `complete.cases()` functions.

ii. Practice removing missing data using the `na.omit()` function.

iii. How can you handle missing values when calculating summary statistics like mean or median?

iv. If you take the mean of a vector with `NA` values, what will the result be?

v.  How are missing values represented in R?

vi. What is `NA` in R? How is it different from `NULL`?

vii. What are some common reasons you may get `NA` values in a dataset?

viii. How can you check if a value is `NA` in R?

## Summary

The learner should now have a firm grasp of what missing data is and why it is a common challenge in data analysis. Additionally, after completing this chapter, the learner should know how to identify and handle missing data with various R functions. This is the final chapter in the book and I hope you have enjoyed your learning journey so far. In the next chapter, I provide a conclusion to the book and some of the next steps you can take to continue on your R learning journey.
