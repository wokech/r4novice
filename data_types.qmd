## Exercises

-   What are the basic data types in R? Give examples of each.

-   How can you check the data type of a variable in R?

-   Use the class(), typeof(), and str() functions to check the data type of objects.

-   Describe the process of coercion in R.

-   Provide an example of implicit and explicit coercion between data types.

-   How can you coerce or convert between different data types in R?

-   What does it mean for an object in R to have attributes? What attributes are commonly used?

## Summary

In this chapter, I have demonstrated the primary data types in R. Additionally, the learner has been trained on how to identify and convert between the different data types. Next, we will review vectors, which are key data structures in R/RStudio.
