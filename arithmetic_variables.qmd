# Basic arithmetic, arithmetic operators, and variables {#sec-arithmetic-variables}

## Questions

-   How can we perform basic arithmetic operations in R?

-   What arithmetic operators can be used in R?

-   How do I assign values to variables?

## Exercises

i.  In R, calculate 3 + 5 and then 4 \* 6.
ii. Assign the value 10 to a variable called x. Then calculate x \^ 2. Next, calculate the expression (3 + x) \* (x - 1) using the x from before.
iii. Declare a variable to store your age and assign a value to it. Print the variable value.
iv. Create variables for the length and width of a rectangle and calculate its area.
v.  Explain the rules for naming variables in R. Provide examples of valid and invalid variable names.
vi. What is operator precedence in R? How does it work for arithmetic operators?
vii. What data types can be used for arithmetic operations in R?
viii. What is the difference between \<- and = for assignment in R?

## Summary

In this chapter, I have demonstrated how to perform basic arithmetic operations and how to use the various arithmetic operators available in R/RStudio. Additionally, the concept of variables and values has been explained, and conventions for appropriately naming variables have been discussed. In the next chapter, we will look at the other types of primary operators in R/RStudio.
