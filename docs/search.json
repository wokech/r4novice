    "text": "12.3 Lesson Content\n\n12.3.1 Introduction\nOne of the most common tasks/activities in data analysis is handling missing values. Missing data are found everywhere; therefore, it is important to learn how to identify and summarize them. Missing data can arise from different sources including nonresponses in surveys or technical issues during data collection.\n\nUnanswered survey questions\nData entry errors\nErrors in measurements\nData merge issues\n\nMissingness presents itself in a variety of ways in R. The most common way to represent a missing value in R is with the value NA. Other reserved values include:\n\nNULL = neither TRUE or FALSE (is.null() identifies a null value and as.null() converts to a null value).\nNaN = impossible values Inf = infinite value obtained by dividing by zero (is.infinite() identifies an infinite value and as.infinite() converts to an infinite value).\n\nExamples of the missing values\nNA = 1/NA\nNaN = 0/0\nInf = 10/0\nNULL = 5/Inf\nCommon strategies for handling missing data\nWhen investigating a dataset, there are a number of functions that can assist with the process. To find missing and non-missing values, the user can work with is.na() and !is.na(), respectively. If any rows contain missing values, one can use na.omit() or drop_na(). If there are missing values in the dataset, the arguments na.rm = TRUE, remove_na = TRUE, or the function complete.cases() can be used to remove missing values.\n\nDeletion: Remove rows or columns with missing values (simplest method but it can lead to bias).\nImputation: Replace missing values with estimated values based on statistical methods (can introduce artificial data).\n\nR has two types of missing data, NA and NULL.\nMissing values can represent a fixed value like 0 (zero) or a negative number.\nMissing can be NA or NaN and represented by is.na() or is.nan()\n\n\n12.3.2 NA\nR uses NA to represent missing data. The NA appears as another element of a vector. To test each element for missingness we use is.na(). Generally, we can use tools such as mi, mice, and Amelia (which will be discussed later) to deal with missing data. The deletion of this missing data may lead to bias or data loss, so we need to be very careful when handling it. In subsequent blog posts, we will look at the use of imputation to deal with missing data.\n\n\n12.3.3 NULL\nNULL represents nothingness or the “absence of anything”. 2 It does not mean missing but represents nothing. NULL cannot exist within a vector because it disappears.",

    "text": "1.3 Lesson Content\n\n1.3.1 Why learn R and RStudio?\nBoth R and Studio are free, open-source software tools that are widely used for statistical analysis and data visualization. R is a programming language that enables the use of code to analyze data. The primary function of the R language is statistical analysis and this can be performed directly in the R console. To ease the analysis process and enhance usability, an integrated development environment (IDE), such as RStudio is recommended. The RStudio IDE is a user-friendly interface that allows the learner to manage multiple script files, use the command-line terminal, easily access file inputs and outputs, and review file/analysis history.\nThe R programming language software was developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman in 1993 (published as open-source in 1995) when they were based at the University of Auckland. Fun fact: R represents the first letter of the first names of the creators. The software is utilized by individuals working for various organizations ranging from academic institutions and healthcare organizations to financial services and information technology companies. In January 2024, the PopularitY of Programming Language (PYPL) Index, which is created by analyzing how often language tutorials are searched on Google, demonstrated that R was the 6th most popular programming language. However, in the same period, the TIOBE index (https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) indicated that R was the 23rd most popular language. This may result from different methodologies for developing the rankings. RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R that was developed by JJ Allaire. This software contains tools that make programming in R easier.\nRStudio extends R’s capabilities by making it easier to import data, write scripts, and generate visualizations and reports. The company RStudio (now Posit since 2022) was founded in 2009 with the main goal of “creating high quality open-source software for data scientists.”\n\n\n1.3.2 Uses of R and RStudio\n\nThe R and RStudio console can be used as a complex scientific calculator.\nThe values of various data types can be assigned to variables using the symbol &lt;- or =.\nBuilt-in functions can be used to manipulate variables.\nBuilt-in datasets can be accessed internally for analysis.\nNew datasets can be imported and new functions can be created for custom analysis.\nTo aid in computational analysis, there exists a large package library (CRAN), as well as a lot of software in development to aid in computational analysis.\n\n\n\n1.3.3 Primary advantages of R and RStudio\n\nR and RStudio are free and open-source software programs which makes them accessible to anyone with a computer and internet connection. This accessibility is key in enabling learners from all socioeconomic levels and geographic regions to have a chance to work with statistical software,\nA large number of user communities exists for the R/RStudio software. These communities (listed in the Appendix) provide learning support and assist with technical challenges,\nNumerous freely available packages/extensions have been developed by the R and RStudio user communities to facilitate all forms of computational analysis, visualization, and publication. The (CRAN) has packages that contain datasets as well as allow one to perform statistical analysis and data visualization,\nR and RStudio allow for reproducible analysis where scripts and workflows can be shared with fellow users, and,\nThe R/RStudio software is cross-platform, which means that it can be used on Linux, Windows, and Mac operating systems.\n\n\n\n1.3.4 Applications of R in different industries\n\nBioinformatics and Healthcare: epidemiological studies, clinical trial analysis, and genetic data analysis.\nFinancial Modeling and Risk Analysis: risk management, algorithmic trading, trading strategies and analysis, time series analysis, and portfolio optimization.\nRetail and Marketing: customer analytics, sales forecasting, market research, web analytics, and customer segmentation.\nSocial Sciences and Humanities: text analysis, surveys and opinion research, social trend analysis, and policy analysis.\nStatistics and Data Analysis: hypothesis testing, data visualization, regression modelling, and statistical inference.\nEnvironmental Science and Climate Change: forecasting weather patterns, modelling climate change, monitoring pollution levels, and ecological modelling.",

user, one of the tasks that you will often engage in is the importation of data from various sources. The commonly used data types include, but are not limited to CSV, TXT, JSON, SQL, SAS, STATA, SPSS, and XLSX. Additionally, R has two native data formats: Rdata (Rda) and Rds. Rdata is for multiple objects, while Rds is for a single R object.\nWhen importing external data, first set the correct working directory. The function getwd() will show the current working directory and setwd(file_path_name) will set the working directory to the file path name specified.\nNOTE: External datasets can be accessed from multiple sources. Examples include can be found in the Appendix 1 (Appendix A). Both of these websites contain large repositories of datasets that can be used for the examples provided below.\nDownload the datasets from Appendix 2 (Appendix B) and save them to your working directory.\nData importation can use base R functions or the readr package, which is part of the tidyverse. We will review both sets of methods in this section\n\n5.3.3.1 Base R\n\nCommonly-used data importation formats\n\nThere is a wide variety of base R functions used for importing external data into R. The main format for importing data is shown below:\nread.___(path to file, header = __, sep = “_”, dec = “_”)\n\nThe argument “path to file” provides the location of the file the user intends to import.\nThe argument header is set as either TRUE or FALSE, if TRUE, R assumes that the file has a header.\nThe sep argument is a group of field separation characters which include , ,, ;, or \\t.\nThe dec argument allows one to set the different characters for decimal points which include . or ,.\nThe stringsAsFactors argument, by default, allows strings to be read as factors. This can be set as TRUE or FALSE\n\nThe main functions for importing data using base R are listed below:\n\n\nread.table() is a general function to read in a file in table format as a data frame.\n\nExample:\n\n\nread.csv() imports data with comma separated values.\n\nExample:\n\n\nread.csv2() is used where comma “,” indicates a decimal point and a semicolon is a field separator.\n\nExample:\n\n\nread.delim() is used for files with tab-separated values, such as TXT and where point “.” is used as a decimal point.\n\nExample:\n\n\nread.delim2() is used for files with tab-separated values such as TXT and where comma “,” is used as a decimal point.\n\nExample:\n\nGeneral data import\n\nFor beginners, one can use read.___(file.choose()) for the interactive selection of files.\nExample:\nread.table(file.choose())\n\nOnline files\n\nTo download and import an online file, we use read.html() and read.xml()\nExample:\nread.html(\"   \")\nread.xml(\"   \")\n\nExcel\n\nlibrary(xlsx)\nread.xlsx(\"file\", sheet number or name)\nExample:\n\nLess frequently used data importation formats\n\n\nFixed-width formats: read.fwf(\"file path\", header = TRUE)\nSPSS/Stata/SAS Data Files: The foreign package reads SPSS SAV files, Stata DTA files, and SAS XPORT libraries.\n\nSteps for use:\nInstall the library\ninstall.packages(\"foreign\")\nLoad the library\nlibrary(foreign)\nSPSS: read.spss(“file path”, to.data.frame = __, use.value.labels = __)\n\nto.data.frame: indicates whether R should treat the loaded data as a dataframe (options are TRUE/FALSE).\nuse.value.labels: indicates whether R should convert variables with value labels into R factors (options are TRUE/FALSE).\n\nStata: read.dta(\"file\", convert.dates = __, convert.factors = __)\nconvert.dates: converts Stata dates to R’s Date class\nconvert.factors: creates factors with Stata value labels\nSAS: read.xport(\"file path\")\nAlternatively, one can utilize specific packages like rio or haven for more complex data formats like SPSS or SAS.\nInstall the library\ninstall.packages(\"haven\")\nLoad the library\nlibrary(haven)\nSPSS: read_sav(\"file path\")\nSAS: read_sas(\"file path\")\n\nNative data formats in R\n\nR Data Files: load(\"____.rda\")\nRDS Files: readRDS(\"____.rds\")\n\nMiscellaneous file formats\n\nJSON\nInstall the library\ninstall.packages(\"rjson\")\nLoad the library\nlibrary(rjson)\nfromJSON(file = \"____\")\nSQL\nInstall the library\ninstall.packages(\"RSQLite\")\nLoad the library\nlibrary(RSQLite)\nsql_connect &lt;- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), \"_____\")\ndbListTables(sql_connect)\nMatlab\nInstall the library\ninstall.packages(\"Rmatlab\")\nLoad the library\nlibrary(Rmatlab)\nreadMat(\"file path\")\n\n5.3.3.2 Tidyverse and the readr package\nTo enhance the speed and efficiency of data imports, the user can work with the readr package that is a part of the tidyverse. This is because the functions in this package allows for faster data imports and work similarly despite the data type that is imported.\n\nCommonly-used data importation formats in the tidyverse\n\n\nImport flat files\n\nread_table()\nread_csv()\nread_csv2()\nread_tsv()\nread_delim()\n\nImport spreadsheets\n\nreadxl\nread_xls()\nread_xlsx()\nread_excel()\nread_excel(“file path”, sheet = “file path”)\nexcel_sheets(“file path”)\n\nImport Google Sheets\n\ngooglesheets4\nread_sheet()\nsheet_names()\n\nLess frequently used data importation formats\n\nread_fwf()\nread_log()\nreadRDS()\nread_lines()\nNOTE: Missing data is a major challenge in data analysis. Strategies for dealing with this are discussed in Chapter 12 “Handling missing data” (Chapter 12).\nOnce the data is imported, the user can glimpse the data with str(), head(), and summary() functions. Additionally, one can check various aspects of the data such as names(), dim, and class to validate that the import was successful.\n\n5.3.4 Saving data and analysis outputs\nBoth the base R functions and the readr package can be used to save data. This data can be in the form of cleaned/rearranged tables, or it can be other analysis outputs such as plots.\n\nBase R\n\nsave()\nsaveRDS()\nwrite.csv()\nwrite.table()\nfwrite()\n\nFlat files\n\nwrite_csv()\nwrite_csv2()\nwrite_tsv()\nwrite_delim()\n\nExcel files\n\nopenxlsx\nwritexl\ntidyxl\nwrite_xlsx()\n\nGoogle Sheets\n\nwrite_sheet()",

They help to organize stored data in a way that the data can be used more effectively. Data structures vary according to the number of dimensions and the data types (heterogeneous or homogeneous) contained.\nThe primary data structures are:\n\nVectors\nLists\nData frames\nMatrices\nArrays\nFactors\n\nIn this lesson, we will review the 2nd set of data structures: matrices, arrays, and factors.\n\n11.3.2 Matrices\nA matrix is a rectangular two-dimensional (2D) homogeneous data set containing rows and columns. It contains real numbers that are arranged in a fixed number of rows and columns.

It can be thought of as a stacked matrix and stores data in more than 2 dimensions (n-dimensional). An array is composed of rows by columns by dimensions.\nExample: an array with dimensions, dim = c(2,3,3), has 2 rows, 3 columns, and 3 matrices.\n\nCreating arrays\n\n\narr_1 &lt;- array(1:12, dim = c(2,3,2))\n\n\narr_1\n\n, , 1\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    1    3    5\n[2,]    2    4    6\n\n, , 2\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    7    9   11\n[2,]    8   10   12\n\n\n\nFilter array by index\n\n\narr_1[1 ,  , ]\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    1    7\n[2,]    3    9\n[3,]    5   11\n\n\n\narr_1[1, ,1]\n\n[1] 1 3 5\n\n\n\narr_1[, , 1]\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    1    3    5\n[2,]    2    4    6\n\n\n\n11.3.4 Factors\nFactors are used to store integers or strings which are categorical. They categorize data and store the data in different levels. This form of data storage is useful for statistical modelling. Examples include TRUE or FALSE and male or female. Useful for handling qualitative datasets.\nNOTE: R has a more efficient method for handling categorical variables using the forcatspackage. This will be discussed in a subsequent series focusing on the tidyverse.\n\nvector &lt;- c(\"Male\", \"Female\")\n\n\nfactor_1 &lt;- factor(vector) \nfactor_1\n\n[1] Male   Female\nLevels: Female Male\n\n\nOR\n\nfactor_2 &lt;- as.factor(vector) \nfactor_2\n\n[1] Male   Female\nLevels: Female Male\n\n\n\nas.numeric(factor_2)\n\n[1] 2 1\n\n\nNOTE: To view the internal structure of various data types described above, the learner can use the str() function.\nExample\n\nstr(m5)\n\n int [1:5, 1:2] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n - attr(*, \"dimnames\")=List of 2\n  ..$ : NULL\n  ..$ : chr [1:2] \"AA\" \"BB\"\n\n\n\nstr(arr_1)\n\n int [1:2, 1:3, 1:2] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...\n\n\n\nstr(factor_1)\n\n Factor w/ 2 levels \"Female\",\"Male\": 2 1",
