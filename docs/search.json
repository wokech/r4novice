    "text": "Why did I write this book?\nThis book is primarily intended to cater to the needs of individuals who have a desire to learn the basics of programming. I focus on R and RStudio because their capabilities may be relevant to a wide variety of individuals and organizations seeking to perform basic statistical analysis and data visualization. Personally, my skills in R and RStudio were gained via classroom instruction, online tutorials and videos, as well as relevant blog posts. A significant disadvantage of some of these resources is the assumption of prior programming knowledge. To address this, I begin the book with instructions for downloading software, navigating the R and RStudio interfaces, and an overview of the basics of R to decrease the cognitive load on novices."

The main prerequisites for learners are basic knowledge of computer applications and experience working with files and folders. This book will primarily focus on the basic R concepts that are hardly emphasized, but that may prove difficult for learners new to programming.\nThe online version of this book is free to use and is licensed under the … .\nThe book is written in Quarto."

    "text": "We have finally come to the end of the “R for Novice Programmers” book. Congratulations on completing this learning journey!\nThe overall goal of this book was to introduce non-programmers or those with very little programming experience to R and RStudio and their use in basic statistical programming. It is hoped that the learners gained new skills and discovered how this software could be used to simplify everyday tasks in their workplaces. The learner should now be able to understand all the topics listed below based on the previously described learning objectives.\n\n\nTable 1: Syllabus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter\nTitle\nCompleted? (Yes/No)\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\n\n1\nOverview of R and RStudio\n\n\n\n2\nDownload and Install R and RStudio\n\n\n\n3\nNavigating the R and RStudio interfaces\n\n\n\n4\nManaging your files and data\n\n\n\n5\nImporting data and saving analysis outputs\n\n\n\n6\nBasic arithmetic, arithmetic operators, and variables\n\n\n\n7\nThe primary types of operators in R\n\n\n\n8\nData Types\n\n\n\n9\nVectors\n\n\n\n10\nData Structures (Part I)\n\n\n\n11\nData Structures (Part II)\n\n\n\n12\nHandling missing data\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\n\nAppendix\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that the learner has mastered the basics, it is time to transition to specific topics such as data wrangling/manipulation, data visualization, and programming. Therefore, I would encourage the learner to review some of the links I have provided in the Appendix and look out for more books in the future which will cover:\n\nData visualization\nTidyverse\nProgramming: Functions, Loops, and Control Statements\nData Science\nStatistics\nMachine Learning and Artificial Intelligence\nPublishing with R Markdown and/or Quarto\nR Shiny\n\nThanks for your participation and for completing this book!"
