This is the website for the book “R for Novice Programmers” written by [William Okech](https://www.williamokech.com). The goal of this book is to introduce non-programmers or those with very little programming experience to the benefits of the R and RStudio software. The main prerequisites for learners are basic knowledge of computer applications and experience working with files and folders. This book will primarily focus on the basic R concepts that are hardly emphasized, but that may prove difficult for learners new to programming.
