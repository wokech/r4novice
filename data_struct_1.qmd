# Data Structures (Part I) {#sec-data-structure-1}

## Questions

-   List the data structures that can be used in R?

-   How do we define the various data structures?

-   What operations can be performed on the different data structures?

-   How do these data structures differ from one another in terms of storage and functionality?

## Learning Objectives

-   Learn about data structures in R, specifically vectors, lists, and dataframes.

-   Define and manipulate vectors, lists, and dataframes.

-   Perform common operations on each data structure.

-   Identify and differentiate between the diverse data structures offered by R.

-   Choose the appropriate data structure based on the type and organization of your data.

-   Understand the strengths and limitations of each structure for efficient analysis.

## Exercises

i.  Explain the characteristics and use cases of lists in R.

ii. Create a list containing a numeric vector, character vector, and logical vector.

iii. How can you add elements to a list in R?

iv. Explain what a data frame is and why it is widely used in R.

v.  Write code to create a data frame with columns for "Name," "Age," and "Gender" for three individuals.

vi. How can you combine two data frames horizontally in R?

vii. Discuss various methods for subsetting elements in data structures.

viii. How do you check the structure of a data frame? What function is used?

ix. How do you access a specific column of a data frame?

x.  What are rownames and colnames in a data frame? How are they useful?

xi. How do you add a new column to an existing data frame?

## Summary

We have now covered half of the key data structures used in R. Knowledge of how to identify and manipulate vectors, lists, and dataframes will help the learner perform numerous computational tasks in R. Next, to complete our review of data structures, we will focus on matrices, arrays, and factors.
