-   Assess the various applications of R across different industries.

## Why learn R and RStudio?

Both R and Studio are free, open-source software tools that are widely used for statistical analysis and data visualization. R is a programming language that enables the use of code to analyze data. The primary function of the R language is statistical analysis and this can be performed directly in the R console. To ease the analysis process and enhance usability, an integrated development environment (IDE), such as RStudio is recommended. The RStudio IDE is a user-friendly interface that allows the learner to manage multiple script files, use the command-line terminal, easily access file inputs and outputs, and review file/analysis history.

The R programming language software was developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman in 1993 (published as open-source in 1995) when they were based at the University of Auckland. *Fun fact: R represents the first letter of the first names of the creators*. The software is utilized by individuals working for various organizations ranging from academic institutions and healthcare organizations to financial services and information technology companies. In January 2024, the [PopularitY of Programming Language (PYPL) Index](https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html), which is created by analyzing how often language tutorials are searched on Google, demonstrated that R was the 6th most popular programming language. However, in the same period, the TIOBE index (https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) indicated that R was the 23rd most popular language. This may result from different methodologies for developing the rankings. RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R that was developed by JJ Allaire. This software contains tools that make programming in R easier.

RStudio extends R’s capabilities by making it easier to import data, write scripts, and generate visualizations and reports. The company RStudio (now Posit since 2022) was founded in 2009 with the main goal of “creating high quality open-source software for data scientists.”

## Uses of R and RStudio

i.  The R and RStudio console can be used as a complex scientific calculator.

ii. The values of various data types can be assigned to variables using the symbol "\<-" or "=".

iii. Built-in functions can be used to manipulate variables.

iv. Built-in datasets can be accessed internally for analysis.

v.  New datasets can be imported and new functions can be created for custom analysis.

vi. To aid in computational analysis, there exists a large package library ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)), as well as a lot of software in development to aid in computational analysis.

## Primary advantages of R and RStudio

i.  R and RStudio are free and open-source software programs which makes them accessible to anyone with a computer and internet connection. This accessibility is key in enabling learners from all socioeconomic levels and geographic regions to have a chance to work with statistical software,

ii. A large number of user communities exists for the R/RStudio software. These communities (listed in the Appendix) provide learning support and assist with technical challenges,

iii. Numerous freely available packages/extensions have been developed by the R and RStudio user communities to facilitate all forms of computational analysis, visualization, and publication. The ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)) has packages that contain datasets as well as allow one to perform statistical analysis and data visualization,

iv. R and RStudio allow for reproducible analysis where scripts and workflows can be shared with fellow users, and,

v.  The R/RStudio software is cross-platform, which means that it can be used on Linux, Windows, and Mac operating systems.

## Applications of R in different industries

-   Discuss applications in fields such as finance, healthcare, and social sciences.

## Exercises

As you embark on your R/RStudio learning journey, I have listed (below) a few questions for you to think about before we get started with the lessons.

i.  Why do you want to learn R and RStudio?

ii. Do you currently use any other software tools for data analysis and visualization? What are the limitations of these tools?

iii. What tasks do you hope to accomplish after completing this training?

iv. Explore the various R/RStudio communities listed in the appendix and consider joining any one of them

## Summary

Overall, I hope you enjoyed learning about the history of R and RStudio, and have seen the advantages of using these software tools. Additionally, we discussed the applications of R in various industries. By the end of this book, the learner should have gained a basic understanding of the R and RStudio software environments and should be ready to tackle more advanced computational tasks.
