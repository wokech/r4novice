    "section": "2.3 Why learn R and RStudio?",
    "text": "2.3 Why learn R and RStudio?\nBoth R and Studio are free, open-source software tools that are widely used for statistical analysis and data visualization. R is a programming language that enables the use of code to analyze data. The primary function of the R language is statistical analysis and this can be performed directly in the R console. To ease the analysis process and enhance usability, an integrated development environment (IDE), such as RStudio is recommended. The RStudio IDE is a user-friendly interface that allows the learner to manage multiple script files, use the command-line terminal, easily access file inputs and outputs, and review file/analysis history. The R programming language software was developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman in 1993 (published as open-source in 1995) when they were based at the University of Auckland. Fun fact: R represents the first letter of the first names of the creators. The software is utilized by individuals working for various organizations ranging from academic institutions and healthcare organizations to financial services and information technology companies. In January 2024, the PopularitY of Programming Language (PYPL) Index (https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html), which is created by analyzing how often language tutorials are searched on Google, demonstrated that R was the 6th most popular programming language. However, in the same period, the TIOBE index (https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) indicated that R was the 23rd most popular language. This may result from different methodologies for developing the rankings. RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R that was developed by JJ Allaire. This software contains tools that make programming in R easier. RStudio extends R’s capabilities by making it easier to import data, write scripts, and generate visualizations and reports. The company RStudio (now Posit since 2022) was founded in 2009 with the main goal of “creating high quality open-source software for data scientists.”"

These communities (listed in the Appendix) provide learning support and assist with technical challenges,\nNumerous freely available packages/extensions have been developed by the R and RStudio user communities to facilitate all forms of computational analysis, visualization, and publication. The (CRAN) has packages that contain datasets as well as allow one to perform statistical analysis and data visualization,\nR and RStudio allow for reproducible analysis where scripts and workflows can be shared with fellow users, and,\nThe R/RStudio software is cross-platform, which means that it can be used on Linux, Windows, and Mac operating systems."

This accessibility is key in enabling learners from all socioeconomic levels and geographic regions to have a chance to work with statistical software,\nA large number of user communities exists for the R/RStudio software. These communities (listed in the Appendix) provide learning support and assist with technical challenges,\nNumerous freely available packages/extensions have been developed by the R and RStudio user communities to facilitate all forms of computational analysis, visualization, and publication. The (CRAN) has packages that contain datasets as well as allow one to perform statistical analysis and data visualization,\nR and RStudio allow for reproducible analysis where scripts and workflows can be shared with fellow users, and,\nThe R/RStudio software is cross-platform, which means that it can be used on Linux, Windows, and Mac operating systems."

I focus on R and RStudio because their capabilities may be relevant to a wide variety of individuals and organizations seeking to perform basic statistical analysis and data visualization. Personally, my skills in R and RStudio were gained via classroom instruction, online tutorials and videos, as well as relevant blog posts. A significant disadvantage of some of these resources is the assumption of prior programming knowledge. To address this, I begin the book with instructions for downloading software, navigating the R and RStudio interfaces, and an overview of the basics of R to decrease the cognitive load on novices."
